# Portfolio

Portfolio of projects completed in my Master of Applied Economics program

The capstone project is my research on investor purchases in the San Francisco housing market. The data was obtained by CoreLogic and contains information on home sales in San Francisco from 2009-2019.

The ML classification project is the final project from my Natural Language Processing course, in which I classify research found on ArXiv.org by topic using article abstracts.
