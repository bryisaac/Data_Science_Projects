    "# Investor Home Purchases in the San Francisco Housing Market\n",
    "## Bryan Isaac\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I estimate the effect of investor purchases on housing prices in San Francisco. The data used comes from CoreLogic and contains information on home sales from 2009-2019 in San Francisco. This data was merged with another dataset of home appraisails by the city to add information on number of rooms, bathrooms, square footage, etc. I begin by cleaning and exploring the data, where I find significant differences in mean and median of absentee purchases vs non-absentee purchases. I then perform my regression analysis with a log-linear model and interactions between absentee purchases and neighborhood to determine if effects are location dependent, and find that in the majority of neighborhoods, absentee purchases are made at a lower rate, but in neighborhoods close to downtown, they are made at a higher rate. Finally, I perform a propensity score matching method where I predict propensity to be an absentee purchase using a logistic regression, and use these propensity scores as a control variable in my regression. Results were similar to the non-propensity score method."
